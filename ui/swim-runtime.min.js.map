protocols and\n * data formats.\n *\n * ### Input tokens\n * Input tokens are modeled as primitive numbers, commonly representing Unicode\n * code points, or raw octets; each `Input` implementation specifies the\n * semantic type of its tokens.  The [[head]]  method peeks at the lookahead\n * token, without consuming it, and the [[step]] method advances the input to\n * the next token.\n *\n * ### Input states\n * An `Input` reader is always in one of three states: _cont_​inue, _empty_, or\n * _done_.  The _cont_ state indicates that a lookahead token is immediately\n * available; the _empty_ state indicates that no additional tokens are\n * available at this time, but that the stream may logically resume at some\n * point in the future; and the _done_ state indicates that the stream has\n * terminated.  [[isCont]] returns `true` when in the _cont_ state; [[isEmpty]]\n * returns `true` when in the _empty_ state; and [[isDone]] returns `true` when\n * in the _done_ state.\n *\n * ### Non-blocking behavior\n * `Input` readers never block.  An `Input` reader that would otherwise block\n * awaiting additional input instead enters the _empty_ state, signaling the\n * input consumer to back off processing the input, but to remain prepared to\n * process additional input in the future.  An `Input` reader enters the _done_\n * state when it encounters the final end of its input, signaling the input\n * consumer to stop processing.  [[Input.empty]] returns an `Input` reader in\n * the _empty_ state.  [[Input.done]] returns an `Input` reader in the _done_\n * state.\n *\n * ### Position tracking\n * The logical position of the lookahead token is made available via the\n * [[mark]] method, with optimized callouts for the byte [[offset]], one-based\n * [[line]] number, and one-based [[column]] in the current line.  The [[id]]\n * method returns a diagnostic identifier for the token stream.\n *\n * ### Cloning\n * An `Input` reader may be [[clone cloned]] to provide an indepently mutable\n * position into a shared token stream.  Not all `Input` implementations\n * support cloning.\n *\n * @see [[InputSettings]]\n * @see [[Parser]]\n */\nexport abstract class Input {\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when a [[head lookahead]] token is immediately available.\n   * i.e. this `Input` is in the _cont_ state.\n   */\n  abstract isCont(): boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when no lookahead token is currently available, but\n   * additional input may be available at some point in the future.  i.e. this\n   * `Input` is in the _empty_ state.\n   */\n  abstract isEmpty(): boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when no lookahead token is currently available, and no\n   * additional input will ever become available.  i.e. this `Input` is in\n   * the _done_ state.\n   */\n  abstract isDone(): boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when no lookahead token is currently available due to an\n   * error with the token stream. i.e. this `Input` is in the `error` state.\n   * When `true`, `trap()` will return the input error\n   */\n  abstract isError(): boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` if this is a partial `Input` will that enter the _empty_\n   * state after it consumes the last available input token.\n   */\n  abstract isPart(): boolean;\n\n   /**\n    * Returns a partial `Input` equivalent to this `Input`, if `part` is `true`;\n    * returns a final `Input` equivalent to this `Input` if `part` is `false`.\n    * The caller's reference to this `Input` should be replaced by the returned\n    * `Input`\n    */\n  abstract asPart(part: boolean): Input;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns the current lookahead token, if this `Input` is in the\n   * _cont_ state.\n   *\n   * @throws [[InputException]] if this `Input` is not in the _cont_ state.\n   */\n  abstract head(): number;\n\n  /**\n   * Advances to the next token, if this `Input` is in the _cont_ state.\n   *\n   * @throws `Error` if this `Input` is not in the _cont_ state.\n   */\n  abstract step(): Input;\n\n  /**\n   * Sets the position of this `Input` to the given `mark`.

* Output tokens are modeled as primitive numbers, commonly representing\n * Unicode code points, or raw octets; each `Output` implementation specifies\n * the semantic type of its tokens.\n *\n * ### Output states\n * An `Output` writer is always in one of three states: _cont_​inue, _full_,\n * or _done_.  The _cont_ state indicates that the stream is ready to write a\n * single token; the _full_ state indicates that the stream is unable to write\n * additional tokens at this time, but that the stream may logically resume at\n * some point in the future; and the _done_ state indicates that the stream has\n * terminated, and that [[bind]] will return the output result.  [[isCont]]\n * returns `true` when in the _cont_ state; [[isFull]] returns `true` when in\n * the _full_ state; and [[isDone]] returns `true` when in the _done_ state.\n *\n * ### Output results\n * An `Output` writer yields a value of type `T`, obtained via the [[bind]]\n * method, representing some implementation defined result of writing the\n * output.  For example, an `Output<string>` implementation may–but is not\n * required to–yield a `string` containing all code points written to the\n * output.\n *\n * ### Non-blocking behavior\n * `Output` writers never block.  An `Output` writer that would otherwise block\n * writing additional output instead enters the _full_ state, signaling the\n * output generator to back off producing the output, but to remain prepared to\n * produce additional output in the future.  An `Output` writer enters the\n * _done_ state when it encounters the final end of its output, signaling to\n * the output generator to stop producing.\n *\n * ### Output settings\n * An output generator may alter the tokens it produces based on its `Output`\n * writer's [[settings]].  Uses include pretty printing and styling generated\n * output.  [[OutputSettings]] subclasses can provide additional parameters\n * understood by specialized output producers.\n *\n * ### Cloning\n * An `Output` writer may be [[clone cloned]] to branch the token stream in an\n * implementation specified manner.  Not all `Output` implementations support\n * cloning.\n *\n * @see [[OutputSettings]]\n * @see [[Writer]]\n */\nexport abstract class Output<T = unknown> implements Builder<number, T> {\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when the next [[write write(number)]] will succeed.\n   * i.e. this `Output` is in the _cont_ state.\n   */\n  abstract isCont(): boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when an immediate `write` will fail, but writes may succeed\n   * at some point in the future.  i.e. this `Output` is in the _full_ state.\n   */\n  abstract isFull(): boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when no `write` will ever again suucced.\n   * i.e. this `Output` is in the _done_ state.\n   */\n  abstract isDone(): boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when an immediate `write` will fail due to an\n   * error with the token stream. i.e. this `Output` is in the `error` state.\n   * When `true`, `trap()` will return the output error.\n   */\n  abstract isError(): boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` if this is a partial `Output` that will enter\n   * the `full` state when it is unable to write additional tokens.\n   */\n  abstract isPart(): boolean;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns a partial `Output` equivalent to this `Output`, if `part` is `true`;\n   * returns a final `Output` equivalent to this `Output` if `part` is `false`.\n   * The caller's reference to this `Output` should be replaced by the returned\n   * `Output`.\n   */\n  abstract asPart(part: boolean): Output<T>;\n\n  /**\n   * Writes a single `token` to the stream, if this `Output` is in the\n   * _cont_ state.\n   *\n   * @return `this`\n   * @throws [[OutputException]] if this `Output` is not in the _cont_ state.\n   */\n  abstract write(token: number): Output<T>;\n\n  /**\n   * Writes the code points of the given `string`.

The `Output` passed to `pull` is only guaranteed to be\n * valid for the duration of the method call; references to the provided\n * `Output` instance must not be stored.\n *\n * ### Writer results\n * A `Writer` produces a written result of type `O`, obtained via the [[bind]]\n * method.  `bind` is only guaranteed to return a result when in the _done_\n * state; though `bind` may optionally make available partial results in other\n * states.  A failed `Writer` provides a write error via the [[trap]] method.\n * `trap` is only guaranteed to return an error when in the _error_ state.\n *\n * ### Continuations\n * A `Writer` instance represents a continuation of how to write remaining\n * `Output`.  Rather than writing a complete output in one go, a `Writer` takes\n * an `Output` chunk and returns another `Writer` instance that knows how to\n * write subsequent `Output` chunks.  This enables non-blocking, incremental\n * writing that can be interrupted whenever an `Output` writer runs out of\n * space.  A `Writer` terminates by returning a continuation in either the\n * _done_ state, or the _error_ state.  [[Writer.done]] returns a `Writer` in\n * the _done_ state.  [[Writer.error]] returns a `Writer` in the _error_ state.\n *\n * ### Forking\n * The [[fork]] method passes an out-of-band condition to a `Writer`, yielding\n * a `Writer` continuation whose behavior may be altered by the given condition.\n * For example, a console `Writer` might support a `fork` condition that changes\n * the color and style of printed text.  The types of conditions accepted by\n * `fork`, and their intended semantics, are implementation defined.\n */\nexport abstract class Writer<I = unknown, O = unknown> {\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when [[pull]] is able to produce `Output`.  i.e. this\n   * `Writer` is in the _cont_ state.\n   */\n  isCont(): boolean {\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when writing has terminated successfully, and [[bind]] will\n   * return the written result.  i.e. this `Writer` is in the _done_ state.\n   */\n  isDone(): boolean {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when writing has terminated in failure, and [[trap]] will\n   * return the write error.  i.e. this `Writer` is in the _error_ state.\n   */\n  isError(): boolean {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Returns a `Writer` that represents the continuation of how to write the\n   * given `input` object.\n   *\n   * @throws `WriterException` if this `Writer` does not know how to write the\n   *         given `input` object.\n   */\n  feed(input: I): Writer<I, O> {\n    throw new WriterException();\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Incrementally writes as much `output` as possible, and returns another\n   * `Writer` that represents the continuation of how to write additional\n   * `Output`.

Continuation of how to parse subsequent [[Input]] tokens from a stream.\n * `Parser` enables efficient, interruptible parsing of network protocols and\n * data formats, without intermediate buffering.\n *\n * ### Input tokens\n * A `Parser` reads tokens from an `Input` reader.  Input tokens are modeled as\n * primitive numbers, commonly representing Unicode code points, or raw octets.\n * Each `Parser` implementation specifies the semantic type of input tokens it\n * consumes.\n *\n * ### Parser states\n * A `Parser` is always in one of three states: _cont_​inue, _done_, or _error_.\n * The _cont_ state indicates that [[feed]] is ready to consume `Input`; the\n * _done_ state indicates that parsing terminated successfully, and that\n * [[bind]] will return the parsed result; the _error_ state indicates that\n * parsing terminated in failure, and that [[trap]] will return the parse error.\n * `Parser` subclasses default to the _cont_ state.\n *\n * ### Feeding input\n * The [[feed]] method incrementally parses as much `Input` as it can, before\n * returning another `Parser` that represents the continuation of how to parse\n * additional `Input`.  The `Input` passed to `feed` is only guaranteed to be\n * valid for the duration of the method call; references to the provided `Input`\n * instance must not be stored.\n *\n * ### Parser results\n * A `Parser` produces a parsed result of type `O`, obtained via the [[bind]]\n * method.  `bind` is only guaranteed to return a result when in the _done_\n * state; though `bind` may optionally make available partial results in other\n * states.  A failed `Parser` provides a parse error via the [[trap]] method.\n * `trap` is only guaranteed to return an error when in the _error_ state.\n *\n * ### Continuations\n * A `Parser` instance represents a continuation of how to parse remaining\n * `Input`.  Rather than parsing a complete input in one go, a `Parser` takes\n * an `Input` chunk and returns another `Parser` instance that knows how to\n * parse subsequent `Input` chunks.  This enables non-blocking, incremental\n * parsing that can be interrupted whenever an `Input` reader runs out of\n * immediately available data.  A `Parser` terminates by returning a\n * continuation in either the _done_ state, or the _error_ state.\n * [[Parser.done]] returns a `Parser` in the _done_ state.  [[Parser.error]]\n * returns a `Parser` in the _error_ state.\n *\n * ### Iteratees\n * `Parser` is an [Iteratee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteratee).  Though\n * unlike strictly functional iteratees, a `Parser` statefully iterates over\n * its `Input`, rather than allocating an object for each incremental input\n * continutaion.  This internal mutability minimizes garbage collector memory\n * pressure, without violating the functional Iteratee abstraction, provided\n * that `feed` logically takes exclusive ownership of its `Input` when invoked,\n * and logically returns ownership of the `Input` in a state that's consistent\n * with the returned `Parser` continuation.\n *\n * ### Immutability\n * A `Parser` should be immutable.  Specifically, an invocation of `feed`\n * should not alter the behavior of future calls to `feed` on the same `Parser`\n * instance.  A `Parser` should only mutate its internal state if it's essential\n * to do so, such as for critical path performance reasons.\n *\n * ### Backtracking\n * `feed` can internally [[Input.clone clone]] its `Input`, if it might need to\n * backtrack.  Keep in mind that, because `Input` is only valid for the duration\n * of a call to `feed`, input must be internally buffered if it needs to be\n * preserved between `feed` invocations.\n *\n * ### Forking\n * The [[fork]] method passes an out-of-band condition to a `Parser`, yielding\n * a `Parser` continuation whose behavior may be altered by the given condition.\n * For example, an HTML `Parser` might `fork` an inner text parser to directly\n * parse an embedded micro format out of an HTML element, based on some\n * out-of-band schema information.  The types of conditions accepted by `fork`,\n * and their intended semantics, are implementation defined.\n */\nexport abstract class Parser<O> {\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when [[feed]] is able to consume `Input`.  i.e. this\n   * `Parser` is in the _cont_ state.\n   */\n  isCont(): boolean {\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when parsing has terminated successfully, and [[bind]] will\n   * return the parsed result.  i.e. this `Parser` is in the _done_ state.\n   */\n  isDone(): boolean {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Returns `true` when parsing has terminated in failure, and [[trap]] will\n   * return the parse error.  i.e. this `Parser` is in the _error_ state.\n   */\n  isError(): boolean {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Incrementally parses as much `input` as possible, and returns another\n   * `Parser` that represents the continuation of how to parse additional\n   * `Input`.
